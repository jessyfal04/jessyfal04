## Yooooo I'm Yepssy ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Masterâ€™s student with a strong passion for DevSecOps, programming, and cloud security.

Currently studying cybersecurity at Paris-CitÃ© University, I aim to broaden my expertise by pursuing a PhD in South Korea to explore advanced cybersecurity topics.

I'm particularly inspired by game companies with a strong R&D culture, like Game Freak. My goal is to contribute to organizations where innovation and security meet to create exceptional user experiences.
